You should have R and RStudio (latest versions) installed to edit this file. You will write code in places marked "TO-DO" to complete the problems. Most of this will be a pure programming assignment but there are some questions that instead ask you to "write a few sentences" which are not R chunks. This is a W class!

The tools for solving these problems can be found in the class practice lectures. I prefer you to use the methods I taught you. If you google and find esoteric code you d on't understand or if you use chat GPT, this doesn't do you too much good in the long run.

To "hand in" the homework, you should follow the github repo setup instructions on the course homepage. DO THIS FIRST!

Once you have your own class repo e.g. located in \~, make a /labs directory. Then go back to \~ and clone the class repo. Then copy this file into your repo/labs directory. Edits made there can be committed and pushed. You must push this completed file by the due date to avoid late penalties.

NOT REQUIRED: After you're done, you have the option to compile this file into a PDF (use the "knit to PDF" button on the submenu above). These final PDF's look pretty as it includes the output of your code. You can push the PDF as well. It will look nice in your portfolio.

# Basic R Skills

-   Print out the numerical constant pi with ten digits after the decimal point using the internal constant `pi`.

```{r}
options(digits = 11)
cat("pi with ten digits after decimal:", pi, "\n")
```

-   Sum up the first 103 terms of the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...

```{r}
cat("The geometric sum with parameter r = 1/2 from k=0 to k=102 is", 
    sum((1/2) ^ (0:102)))
```

-   Find the product of the first 37 terms in the sequence 1/3, 1/6, 1/9 ...

```{r}
cat("The product of the first 37 terms in the sequence 1/(3k) is",
    prod(1/(3 * (1:37))))
```

-   Find the product of the first 387 terms of `1 * 1/2 * 1/4 * 1/8 *` ...

```{r}
cat("The product of the first 387 terms of the geometric sequence (1/2)^k yields",
    prod((1/2)^(0:386)))
```

-   Is this answer *exactly* correct?

No. The computation was subject to arithmetic underflow because the granularity of the floating-point representation is not precise enough to represent the small value implied by the product.

-   Figure out a means to express the answer more exactly. Not compute exactly, but express more exactly.

One way to handle it is to convert the product into a sum by applying the logarithm. We'll begin by assigning the name $s$ to the result:

$$
s = \prod_{k=0}^{386}\frac{1}{2^k}
$$ Next, we can apply the natural logarithm on both sides and leverage its product and power properties: $$
\ln(s) = \ln\left(\prod_{k=0}^{386}\frac{1}{2^k}\right)\\
\ln(s) = \sum_{k=0}^{386}\ln\left(\frac{1}{2^k}\right)\\
\ln(s) = \sum_{k=0}^{386}\ln\left(2^{-k}\right)\\
\ln(s) = \sum_{k=0}^{386}-k\cdot \ln(2)\\
\ln(s) = -\ln(2) \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{386}k\\
$$

If we applying $e$ to both sides, the $\ln$ cancels on the left, giving $s$. On the right-hand side, we get $e$ raised to the following power:

```{r}
cat(-log(2) * sum(1:386))
```

Hence, the exact result is $e^{-\ln(2)\cdot \sum_{k=0}^{386}k}$. If we used the formula $\sum_{k=1}^{n}k=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, then we can use properties of logarithms to simplify this to $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{74691}$.

-   Create the sequence `x = [Inf, 20, 18, ..., -20]`.

```{r}
# The sequence function generates 20 to -2, and the combine function tacks on Inf at the start.
x = c(Inf, seq(from = 20, to = -20, by = -2))
cat(x)
rm(x)
```

-   Create the sequence `x = [log_3(Inf), log_3(100), log_3(98), ... log_3(-20)]`.

```{r}
# Similar to the example above, but we use the vectorized logarithm (base 3) operation.
x = log(c(Inf, seq(from = 100, to = -20, by = -2)), base = 3)
cat(x)
```

-   Comment on the appropriateness of the non-numeric values NAN and -Inf.

Note that the `seq()` function is given arguments to generate the even integers in the closed range $[-20, 100]$. The values are generated in reverse, and then passed as arguments to `log()`. Recalling that the domain of $\log$ is the set of positive real numbers (the interval $(0,\infty)$), it is reasonable that `-Inf` is produced because $0$ is one of the inputs in th e generated sequence, and $\lim_{x\to 0}\log(x)=-\infty$. On the other hand, `NaN` values are also reasonable because `log` is attempting to produce a result when given negative inputs (the even numbers from $-2$ to $-20$), which are outside of its domain when thought of as a real-valued function.

-   Create a vector of booleans where the entry is true if `x[i]` is positive and finite.

```{r}
positive_values = is.finite(x) & (x > 0)
cat(positive_values)
rm(positive_values)
```

-   Locate the indices of the non-real numbers in this vector. Hint: use the `which` function. Don't hesitate to use the documentation via `?which`.

```{r}
?which
cat("indices of non-real numbers:\n", which(!is.finite(x)), "\n")
cat("values of at the indices:\n", x[!is.finite(x)], "\n")
```

-   Locate the indices of the infinite quantities in this vector.

```{r}
indices_for_infs = which(is.infinite(x))
cat(indices_for_infs, "\n")
rm(indices_for_infs)
```

-   Locate the indices of the min and max in this vector. Hint: use the `which.min` and `which.max` functions.

```{r}
?which.min
?which.max
x_without_infs = ifelse(is.infinite(x), NA, x)
# alternative we can do it as follows
# x[is.infinite(x)] = NA
# but overriding the data will make it difficult to make queries about it later
# According to documentation, missing and NaN values are discarded, so the transformation above makes use of that
cat("minimum real number in x is at index", which.min(x_without_infs), "\n")
cat("maximum real number in x is at index", which.max(x_without_infs), "\n")
rm(x_without_infs)
```

-   Count the number of unique values in `x`.

```{r}
cat(length(unique(x)), "unique values\n")
```

-   Cast `x` to a factor. Do the number of levels make sense?

```{r}
?factor
factor(x)
```

The number of levels makes sense because there are 53 unique values in the vector, so each one gets its own category.

-   Cast `x` to integers. What do we learn about R's infinity representation in the integer data type?

```{r}
x
as.integer(x)
```

From the output it appears that R is unable to represent infinity (`-Inf` or `Inf`) or `NaN` as an integer, so it defaults to producing `NA` values.

-   Use `x` to create a new vector `y` containing only the real numbers in x.

```{r}
y = x[which(is.finite(x))]
#or simply, x[is.finite(x)]
cat(y)
rm(x, y)
```

-   Use the left rectangle method to numerically integrate x\^2 from 0 to 1 with rectangle width size 1e-6.

```{r}
a = 0
b = 1
delta = 1e-6
# Integrates from a to b using subintervals of size delta and the right endpoint as the sample point.
cat(delta * sum(seq(from = a + delta, to = b, by = delta)^2))
rm(a, b, delta)
```

-   Calculate the average of 100 realizations of standard Bernoullis in one line using the `sample` function.

A Bernoulli trial has one or two possible values: 0 or 1. We tell the `sample` function to pick from those two values with `c(0, 1)`, and we specify `replace = TRUE` so that it performs sampling with replacement (since of course it's impossible to pick 100 distinct values from a set of size 2).

```{r}
?sample
?mean
mean(sample(c(0, 1), size = 100, replace = TRUE))
```

-   Calculate the average of 500 realizations of Bernoullis with p = 0.9 in one line using the `sample` and `mean` functions.

```{r}
# By default, the different values being sampled have equal weight. To override this, we use the prob parameter.
?sample
n = 500
p = 0.9
mean(sample(c(0, 1), size = n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1 - p, p)))
```

-   Calculate the average of 1000 realizations of Bernoullis with p = 0.9 in one line using `rbinom`.

```{r}
# This works because a Binomial(1, p) random variable is equivalent to a Bernoulli(p) random variable.
?rbinom
mean(rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = p))
rm(n, p)
```

-   Let `n = 50`. Create a n x n matrix `R` of exactly 50% entries 0's, 25% 1's 25% 2's. These values should be in random locations.

```{r}
n = 50
?matrix
# We use the rep command to generate the desired frequency of each entry, combine it with the c() function,
# and shuffle the result with sample.
R = matrix(
  sample(
    c(
      rep(0, n * n / 2),
      rep(1, n * n / 4),
      rep(2, n * n / 4)
     ),
  ), nrow = n, ncol = n)
rm(n)
```

-   Randomly punch holes (i.e. `NA`) values in this matrix so that an each entry is missing with probability 30%.

```{r}
p = 0.3
?runif
R[,] = ifelse(runif(length(R)) < p, NA, R)
# Other approaches:
# R[sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), size = n^2, prob=(0.3, 0.7), replace = TRUE)] = NA
# Ths one is a simpler version of the one I wrote above:
# R[runif(n^2) < 0.3] = NA
rm(p)
```

-   Sort the rows in matrix `R` by the largest row sum to lowest. Be careful about the NA's!

```{r}
?rowSums
?sort
# na.rm for rowSums discards NA values during computation
# index.return in sort returns the new index for each value after the sort
sorted_result = sort(rowSums(R, na.rm = TRUE), decreasing = TRUE, index.return = TRUE)
# For example, sort_indices[1] is the index of the row in R whose sum is maximal (since we used decreasing = TRUE)
# List object must be "unlisted" in order to use it for indexing into matrix
class(sorted_result)
?list
R[unlist(sorted_result$ix, use.names = FALSE),]
rm(sorted_result)
```

-   We will now learn the `apply` function. This is a handy function that saves writing for loops which should be eschewed in R. Use the apply function to compute a vector whose entries are the standard deviation of each row. Use the apply function to compute a vector whose entries are the standard deviation of each column. Be careful about the NA's! This should be one line.

```{r}
?apply
# Computes the standard deviation of a vector
?sd
# Margin 1 is rows
apply(R, MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(x) { sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)})
# Margin 2 is columns
apply(R, MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(x) { sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)})
```

-   Use the `apply` function to compute a vector whose entries are the count of entries that are 1 or 2 in each column. This should be one line.

```{r}
# Margin 2 for columns; TRUE values are treated as 1, and FALSE as 0.
?sum
apply(R, MARGIN = 2, FUN = function(x) { sum( !is.na(x) & (x == 1 | x == 2)) })
```

-   Use the `split` function to create a list whose keys are the column number and values are the vector of the columns. Look at the last example in the documentation `?split`.

```{r}
?split
?col
# col(R)
split(R, f = col(R))
rm(R)
```

-   In one statement, use the `lapply` function to create a list whose keys are the column number and values are themselves a list with keys: "min" whose value is the minimum of the column, "max" whose value is the maximum of the column, "pct_missing" is the proportion of missingness in the column and "first_NA" whose value is the row number of the first time the NA appears.

```{r}
?lapply
# Missing and NA are ignored
?which.min
?sort
?Position
lapply(X = split(R, f = col(R)), FUN = function(x) {
  list(
    min = max(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = min(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    pct_missing = sum(is.na(x)) / length(x),
    first_NA = Position(function(value) { is.na(value) }, x)
  )
})
```

-   Set a seed and then create a vector `v` consisting of a sample of 1,000 iid normal realizations with mean -10 and variance 100.

```{r}
seed = 2025
set.seed(seed)

?rnorm
sample_size = 1000
mu = -10
var = 100
v = rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = mu, sd = sqrt(var))
v
```

-   Repeat this exercise by resetting the seed to ensure you obtain the same results.

```{r}
set.seed(seed)
?rnorm
u = rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = mu, sd = sqrt(var))
cat("number of distinct values generated:", sum(u != v))
```

-   Find the average of `v` and the standard error of `v`.

Thanks to Andrew, who explained that the standard error $SE$ is given by

$$
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, and $n$ is the number of samples.

```{r}
cat("the mean is", mean(v), "and the standard error is", sd(v) / sqrt(sample_size), "\n")
```

-   Find the 5%ile of `v` and use the `qnorm` function to compute what it theoretically should be. Is the estimate about what is expected by theory?

```{r}
# The value at index 100 * 0.05 = 5 after sorting should be the 5th percentile
sort(v)[as.integer( length(v) * 0.05 )]

# Let's see what qnorm reports
qnorm(p = 0.05, mean = mu, sd = sqrt(var))
```
Yes the estimate is reasonably close to what it theoretically should be.

-   What is the percentile of `v` that corresponds to the value 0? What should it be theoretically? Is the estimate about what is expected by theory?

For a normal random variable with a mean $\mu = -10$ and a variance $\sigma^2=100$, we expect $0$ to be one standard deviation above the mean.
The empirical rule says it should be 34% above the mean, so it should be at the 84th percentile. Let's see what it actually is according to
the cumulative distribution function:

```{r}
percentile_for_zero = pnorm(q = 0, mean = mu, sd = sqrt(var))
percentile_for_zero
```
This is consistent with what it should be theoretically.

-   Create a function `my_reverse` which takes as required input a vector `v` and returns the vector in reverse where the first entry is the last entry, etc. No function calls are allowed inside your function otherwise that would defeat the purpose of the exercise! (Yes, there is a base R function that does this called `rev`). Use `head` on `v` and `tail` on `my_reverse(v)` to verify it works.

```{r}
# does not modify v itself
my_reverse = function(v) {
  v[seq(from = length(v), to = 1)]
}
cat("head of v\n", head(v), "\n")
cat("tail of my_reverse(v):\n", tail(my_reverse(v)),"\n")
cat("my_rev and rev match:", all.equal(rev(v), my_reverse(v)))
```

-   Create a function `flip_matrix` which takes as required input a matrix, an argument `dim_to_rev` that returns the matrix with the rows in reverse order or the columns in reverse order depending on the `dim_to_rev` argument. Let the default be the dimension of the matrix that is greater. If the number of rows

```{r}
?nrow
flip_matrix = function(A, dim_to_rev = ifelse(nrow(A) >= ncol(A), "row", "col")) {
  if (dim_to_rev == "row") {
    matrix(unlist(rev(split(A, row(A)))), nrow=nrow(A), ncol=ncol(A), byrow = TRUE)
  } else {
    matrix(unlist(rev(split(A, col(A)))), nrow = nrow(A), ncol=ncol(A))
  }
}
?matrix
?round
test_matrix = matrix(round(runif(6), digits = 2), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
test_matrix
flip_matrix(test_matrix)
flip_matrix(test_matrix, dim_to_rev = "col")
flip_matrix(test_matrix, dim_to_rev = "row")
```

-   Create a list named `my_list` with keys "A", "B", ... where the entries are arrays of size 1, 2 x 2, 3 x 3 x 3, etc. Fill the array with the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. Make 8 entries according to this sequence.

```{r}
?Map
?list
my_list = list()
for (k in 1:8) {
  my_list[[LETTERS[k]]] = array(rep(k, k^k), dim = rep(k, k))
}
my_list
```

Run the following code:

```{r}
lapply(my_list, object.size)
```

Use `?object.size` to read about what these functions do. Then explain the output you see above. For the later arrays, does it make sense given the dimensions of the arrays?

```{r}
?object.size
class(my_list$A[[1]])
lapply(1, object.size)
```

The size of the list is displayed by showing the size of its values, which are arrays. Each successive array is of larger dimension, the $k$th
array storing $k^k$ entries. Assuming that the entries are integers represented as 4 byte entities, this would be about $k^k * 4$ bytes total. That's not entirely true because R does not have scalar types and uses arrays even for single values. Thus there is likely some overhead. However, note for example that the array corresponding to `"H"` is of size $8^8$, and $8^8\cdot 4=67108864$, which is fairly close to the output value of $67109104$.

## Packages

Install the package `pacman` using regular base R.

```{r}
install.packages("pacman")
```

First, install the package `testthat` (a widely accepted testing suite for R) from <https://github.com/r-lib/testthat> using `pacman`. If you are using Windows, this will be a long install, but you have to go through it for some of the stuff we are doing in class. LINUX (or MAC) is preferred for coding. If you can't get it to work, install this package from CRAN (still using `pacman`), but this is not recommended long term.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(testthat)
```

-   Create vector `v` consisting of all numbers from -100 to 100 and test using the second line of code su

```{r}
v = seq(-100, 100)
expect_equal(v, -100 : 101)
```

If there are any errors, the `expect_equal` function will tell you about them. If there are no errors, then it will be silent.

Test the `my_reverse` function using the following code:

```{r}
expect_equal(my_reverse(v), rev(v))
expect_equal(my_reverse(c("A", "B", "C")), c("C", "B", "A"))
```

## A little about strings

-   Use the `strsplit` function and `sample` to put the sentences in the string `lorem` below in random order. You will also need to manipulate the output of `strsplit` which is a list. You may need to learn basic concepts of regular expressions.

```{r}
lorem = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi posuere varius volutpat. Morbi faucibus ligula id massa ultricies viverra. Donec vehicula sagittis nisi non semper. Donec at tempor erat. Integer dapibus mi lectus, eu posuere arcu ultricies in. Cras suscipit id nibh lacinia elementum. Curabitur est augue, congue eget quam in, scelerisque semper magna. Aenean nulla ante, iaculis sed vehicula ac, finibus vel arcu. Mauris at sodales augue. "

?strsplit
shuffled_lorem = paste(sample(unlist(strsplit(lorem, split = "\\s+"))), collapse = " ")
print(shuffled_lorem)
```

You have a set of names divided by gender (M / F) and generation (Boomer / GenX / Millenial):

-   M / Boomer "Theodore, Bernard, Gene, Herbert, Ray, Tom, Lee, Alfred, Leroy, Eddie"
-   M / GenX "Marc, Jamie, Greg, Darryl, Tim, Dean, Jon, Chris, Troy, Jeff"
-   M / Millennial "Zachary, Dylan, Christian, Wesley, Seth, Austin, Gabriel, Evan, Casey, Luis"
-   F / Boomer "Gloria, Joan, Dorothy, Shirley, Betty, Dianne, Kay, Marjorie, Lorraine, Mildred"
-   F / GenX "Tracy, Dawn, Tina, Tammy, Melinda, Tamara, Tracey, Colleen, Sherri, Heidi"
-   F / Millennial "Samantha, Alexis, Brittany, Lauren, Taylor, Bethany, Latoya, Candice, Brittney, Cheyenne"

Create a list-within-a-list that will intelligently store this data.

```{r}
#HINT: 
# strsplit("Theodore, Bernard, Gene, Herbert, Ray, Tom, Lee, Alfred, Leroy, Eddie", split = ", ")[[1]]
# TODO
list(
  Male = list(
    Boomer = strsplit("Theodore, Bernard, Gene, Herbert, Ray, Tom, Lee, Alfred, Leroy, Eddie", split = ", ")[[1]],
    GenX = strsplit("Marc, Jamie, Greg, Darryl, Tim, Dean, Jon, Chris, Troy, Jeff", split = ", ")[[1]],
    Millenial = strsplit("Zachary, Dylan, Christian, Wesley, Seth, Austin, Gabriel, Evan, Casey, Luis", split = ", ")[[1]]
  ),
  Female = list(
    Boomer = strsplit("Gloria, Joan, Dorothy, Shirley, Betty, Dianne, Kay, Marjorie, Lorraine, Mildred", split = ", ")[[1]],
    GenX = strsplit("Tracy, Dawn, Tina, Tammy, Melinda, Tamara, Tracey, Colleen, Sherri, Heidi", split = ", ")[[1]],
    Millenial = strsplit("Samantha, Alexis, Brittany, Lauren, Taylor, Bethany, Latoya, Candice, Brittney, Cheyenne", split = ", ")[[1]])
)
```

Now cleanup the namespace by deleting all stored objects and functions:

```{r}
rm(list= ls())
```
