	\section{Introduction}
	It has been suggested that the maximum human lifespan is fixed at around
	122 years, and is subject to natural constraints \cite{NLoM-maximal-lifespan}.
	In contrast, the average life expectancy of a newborn \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{increase }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{increased }\DIFaddend from 32 years in 1900 to
	71 years in 2021; on average, humans are living longer \cite{owid-life-expectancy}.

	As \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lifetime }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{life }\DIFaddend expectancy increases, it is natural to ask why we should care.
	One idea is that humans inherently strive for survival, so we naturally look
	for ways to live longer. Another answer is that a longer life brings more
	opportunities to nurturing social relationships \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{such as }\DIFdelend with family and friends\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
	}\DIFaddend or pursuing career and education goals. To what extent, then, can people influence their
	longevity to enable them to fulfill these life goals? The Danish Twin Study
	established that only 20\% of how long the average person lives is dictated by our
	genes, whereas the other 80\% is dictated by our lifestyle \cite{PMC-blue-zones}.
	While on a quest to uncover aspects of lifestyle that increase longevity,
	Dan Buettner from National Geographic discovered regions of high longevity known
	as blue zones \cite{PMC-blue-zones}. Blue zones are regions that consist of a large
	number of centenarians (people aged over 100) whose longevity is attributed to healthy
	lifestyles.

	There are 9 primary lifestyle habits that people in blue zones adhere to which
	contribute to slow-aging. These factors can be summarized as: being in environments that
	naturally encourage movement; having a meaningful life purpose; having effective routines to
	cope with stress; \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{eat }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{eating  }\DIFaddend until 80\% full and eat less later times of the day; \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{eat }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{eating }\DIFaddend beans
	and little pork; \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{drink }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{drinking }\DIFaddend alcohol moderately; \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{get }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{feeling }\DIFaddend a sense of belonging by being part of
	some community; \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{prioritize }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{prioritizing }\DIFaddend loved ones, such as family and friends; \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{surround }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{surrounding }\DIFaddend yourself
	with groups of people that encourage healthy behaviors \cite{PMC-blue-zones}.
	A study by Harvard's School of Public Health further strengthens the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{evidence
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{case
	}\DIFaddend that a healthy lifestyle can increase longevity. The study considered the influence
	of 5 factors similar to the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ones }\DIFaddend we considered for blue zones, such as maintaining
	healthy eating patterns, not smoking, getting 3.5 hours of vigorous physical
	activity, drinking alcohol in moderation, and maintaining a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normal }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{``normal" }\DIFaddend weight.
	The study estimated that women at age 50 who did not adopt any of these 5 healthy
	habits were estimated to live until 79, whereas those who did were estimated to live
	to 93.1 years \cite{NIH-healthy-habits}.

	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A life insurance company may
	want to predict lifespan to maximize their profit from a customer's life
	insurance; on the flip side, a customer may use it to decide whether getting
	life insurance is worth it. A home buyer may weight the cost of buying
	a home against how many years they expect they will be able to live in it.
	Economists may want to understand how general trends in lifespan may
	impact the economy. For example, a home buyer of age 40 considering committing to
	a 30 year home payment may want to know if they will live long enough
	to enjoy their home for at least another 20 years past that. If a model
	predicts they will age to 95, it ought to be accurate to within about 5
	years for it to be useful. Perhaps after learning this prediction, the
	home buyer might adjust their lifestyle to help them attain their goal.
	}\DIFaddend In this paper, I explore the extent to which specific factors can
	lengthen a person's expected lifespan.

	\DIFaddend \section{Understand Reality via Models}
	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In this paper, the phenomenon of interest is human lifespan.
	}\DIFaddend A phenomenon is a naturally occurring event whose manifestation can be observed.
	Phenomena range from natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes to
	population growth and change in stock prices and even to gravity and magnetism.
	 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In this paper, the phenomenon of interest is human lifespan. }\DIFdelend Phenomena can
	be quite complicated, and their study often requires making \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simplifying }\DIFdelend general
	assumptions to simplify their analysis. The result of this simplification is
	called a model.

	A model is an abstraction, or an approximation, or a simplification, of reality.
	The goal of a model is to remove elements that affect a phenomenon whose consideration
	may be infeasible or whose contribution may be relatively insignificant.
	The adage ``an apple a day keeps the doctor away" may be thought of as a model
	for living a healthy life. Another one is ``Sitting is the new smoking",
	which warns that a sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for cardiovascular
	morbidity \cite{NLoM-sitting-smoking}. A person who intends to lead a healthy
	life may heed these proverbs by exercising more and eating healthier foods,
	but may quickly realize a problem. How many apples should they eat? How
	much sitting is too much sitting? The problem is that models can be ambiguous;
	though the qualitative description is useful for everyday talk, our inability
	to quantify the effect of each component \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{makes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can make }\DIFaddend it difficult to apply \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{them}\DIFaddend . If we are to
	use models to guide the choices we make, we need something more rigorous.

	A mathematical model is a specialization of a model that aims to establish a
	precise relationship between two or more quantities. To create a mathematical model,
	it is necessary to identify responses, also known as outputs\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend and inputs, also known
	as factors, as well as ways to measure them. The Navier-Stokes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{equation}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{equations}\DIFaddend , for example, 
	are a mathematical model believed to aid in explaining and predicting breeze and turbulence.
	\cite{Clay-navier-stokes}. Even without the availability of exact solutions, the model has
	been useful in navigation in boats in water and modern jet flight across the sky.
	It is interesting to note that in spite of the ingenuous principles
	that Navier-Stokes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{equation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{equations }\DIFaddend embody, they are still far from perfect.
	In his book, Silver shared that a mathematician once said ``The best model for a cat is a cat"
	\cite{Silver-signal-and-noise}. The mathematician meant that no model is perfect, for
	missing any detail inevitably leads to some inaccuracy. It is also important
	to remember that a model, mathematical or not, is not reality. Thus, even though
	models are useful, we ought to be careful not to let them be the final word on
	the phenomenon that we are attempting to describe with them.

	\section{A Model for the Lifespan Phenomenon}

	Let us consider how we would make a mathematical model for predicting the lifespan
	of an individual. A phenomenon has a response or output, mathematically denoted as $y$,
	whose values belong to a response space, a set denoted $\mathcal{Y}$. In human lifespan,
	$y$ is the number of years that a person lives from birth to death, which can be $67.4$ years
	or $100.12$ years, for example. This quantity can be measured accurately from a person's birth
	and death certificates.	 Thus, the response space $\mathcal{Y}=\mathbb{R}$, the set of all
	real numbers. To devise an exact mathematical relationship involving lifespan $y$,
	we need to identify its causal drivers, $z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_t$, and an exact functional
	relationship $t$ so that we may write
	\begin{align*}
		y = t(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_t).
	\end{align*}

	The causal drivers are the true causal input information of the phenomenon's response.
	Here are some possible causal drivers influencing the lifespan of an individual:
	\begin{align*}
		z_1 &= \text{Number of fatal accidents experienced}\\
		z_2 &= \text{Presence or absence of genes to combat deadly disease}\\
		z_3 &= \text{Ability to gather healthy foods}\\
		z_4 &= \text{Average daily rate of sustained mental stress}\\
		z_5 &= \text{Level of physical aptitude}\\
		z_6 &= \text{Grit and desire for survival and longevity}
	\end{align*}
	One can argue that these inputs may not include all that goes into living
	a long life, or that some of these are not in fact causal drivers. In general,
	we do not have the omniscience to know exactly which inputs directly cause the
	response of a phenomenon to change. However, even if we did, we face the challenge
	of how to precisely measure these causal drivers. For example, it is impossible
	to know how many accidents a person will experience throughout their life.
	Similarly, the mental stress that a person experiences is linked to their
	life experiences and circumstances, which are always changing in unpredictable ways.
	Even if we did know all the causal drivers and were able to measure them,
	we would be hard-pressed to establish an exact functional relationship $t$
	relating them to the response $y$, because there are uncountably-many
	ways to relate these quantities.

	\section{Approximating Causal Drivers with Features}

	To deal with the infeasibility of obtaining true causal information, we
	introduce quantities known as features. A list of features $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p$\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
	}\DIFaddend also known as predictors or covariates, act as proxies to the unattainable
	true drivers which are the $z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_t$. By proxies we mean that these
	features stand for them when describing the phenomenon. The list of
	features $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p$ is said to belong to a covariate space
	$\mathcal{X}$, which consists of all the possible lists involving different
	values of these features. We can express $y$ through a functional relationship
	in terms of the features, but we must account for the fact that the features
	do not carry the same information density as the true causal drivers.
	That is, whereas we have the exact equation $y=t(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_t)$,
	we only \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an approximate equation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have an approximation }\DIFaddend $y\approx f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p)$ for
	some function $f:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$, or
	\begin{align*}
		y = t(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_t)=f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) + \delta
	\end{align*}
	where $\delta$ is a positive real number. The quantity $\delta$ is known as ignorance
	error, encapsulating the error incurred by expressing $y$ in terms the
	features $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p$ that are not truly causal. The following 
	is list of features that may affect lifespan:
	\begin{align*}
		x_1 &= \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\text{Number of steps walked each day, an integer}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\text{Daily average number of steps walked each day, an integer}}\DIFaddend \\
		x_2 &= \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\text{Average daily number of hours of sleep}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\text{Daily average number of hours of sleep}}\DIFaddend \\
		x_3 &= \text{Daily average number of 12-oz cups equivalent to a wine glass}\\
		x_4 &= \text{Daily average number of cigars a person smokes}\\
		x_5 &= \text{Weekly average number of hours of pleasurable social interactions}\DIFaddbegin \\
		\DIFadd{x_6 }&\DIFadd{= \text{Current age of individual in years}
	}\DIFaddend \end{align*}
	We learned earlier how centenarians in blue zones heed the habits embodied
	by some of these features (and more), so it is reasonable to believe that they affect
	lifespan. The advent of smart watches makes measuring $x_1$ and $x_2$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{realistic}\DIFaddend , which can
	be a good measure of a person's level of physical activity and aptitude and
	a way to help cope with mental stress, respectively. Admittedly $x_3$
	may not be as accurate as possible because not \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{even all wines }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{all wines or alcoholic beverages
	}\DIFaddend have the same alcohol content. However, a person can take note of when they purchase
	a box or a single unit of bottles of cans of some drink, and maintain a diary with
	a headcount of when and how much they consumed. Similarly, cigars are sold in boxes
	of multiple units, so a person can track their purchases to know $x_4$, how many 
	cigars they have smoked. For $x_5$, a person can refer to their extracurricular
	activities, such as outings for restaurants or dancing, video or board game sessions,
	or even time spent at home talking with friends and family; a calendar \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or
	a diary }\DIFaddend can help track this. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Finally, $x_6$ may be important to account for
	the fact that as we age older, we may be less likely to continue to live,
	or may be more susceptible to certain health problems.
	}

	\DIFadd{A reasonable age to start collecting information about a person's features
	is 21. In most countries, since in most countries a person of this age is
	old enough to buy alcohol or cigars. People at this age also tend to own
	smart phones or smart watches, which tend to automatically track walk
	and sleep activity. At age 35, we can start making predictions about how
	long said person will live. As the person ages, we continue tracking
	their features to make refined and more accurate predictions as time passes.
	}\DIFaddend \section{Stationarity}
	A reasonable question is whether \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the causal drivers , features , and functional
	relationships between them and the response $y$ changes over time.
	A }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a model we create will continue to be valid.
	change. A phenomenon is stationary if the same drivers or features that we use in a
	model today (and features) still influence the response in the same way when we observe
	the model (say, 10 years later ) under the same functional relationship $t$ or $f$.
	When the relationship changes, the }\DIFaddend phenomenon is said to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{be stationary when such change does not occur. The significance
	is that if we create a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{not be stationary. A
	}\DIFaddend model for a non-stationary model \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, it may not be applicable
	in the future as the relationships between the inputs and outputs change.
	When that happens, we say that the model drifts.
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is said to drift, because the model encapsulates
	assumptions whose validity may not hold as the phenomenon changes, rendering
	the model invalid.
	}

	\DIFaddend In general, most phenomena are not stationary, and we might only be able to
	achieve stationarity if we have a closed system. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In particular, human lifespan
	is not a stationary phenomenon. }\DIFaddend For example, though lifespan is thought to have
	a maximum value, humans might make a scientific discovery to extend it\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
	and in turn it may render our current model obsolete. Human lifespan
	is not a stationary phenomenon, so we need to acknowledge that in developing
	for it, we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Thus,
	if our model is built around the assumption that humans can live at most 122
	years, it }\DIFaddend will need to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{update it so that its accuracy does not suffer
	heavily. For example, if a scientific breakthrough suggests that there
	is no maximal lifespan or that there is a way to extend it, we should
	consider adding features that take this development into account}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be revised}\DIFaddend .
	\section{Supervised Learning}
	So far, we can express the human lifespan response as
	\begin{align*}
		y = f(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, x_6}\DIFaddend )+\delta
	\end{align*}
	where we rely on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$p=5$ features. We must humble ourselves once more
	and acknowledge that it is practically impossible to know the exact
	functional form $f$. Just like for $t$, there are infinitely-many ways
	to relate the features to the response. Moreover, there may not be analytical or exact solution. An }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$p=6$ features. However, the truth is that we cannot
	hope to attain an analytical solution. Earlier we saw an }\DIFaddend example of this
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was alluded to
	earlier }\DIFdelend when we mentioned the Navier-Stokes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{equation}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{equations}\DIFaddend , for which no \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{solution is known \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Clay-navier-stokes}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{exact solutions exist
	in spite of the ambitious effort of the mature }\DIFaddend theory of differential equations
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is ambitious in its attempt to yield exact or analytical
	solutions, but we must accept that most problems do not admit such
	solutions, and the human lifespan phenomenon is no exception}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Clay-navier-stokes}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Instead of giving up, we can adjust our expectations and
	settle for an empirical solution. An empirical solution is an
	approximate solution that can be obtained from historical data, and
	the framework for obtaining a solution in this way is called supervised
	learning. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Another name for supervised learning is machine learning.
	}

	\DIFadd{The framework of supervised learning consists of a set of
	training (also known as historical) data $\mathbb{D}$, which consists of known
	inputs and their corresponding correct outputs. It is supervised in
	the sense that an entity who has collected the data has gone through
	the trouble of ensuring the data is correct for the phenomenon.
	We then decide on set of candidate functions $\mathcal{H}$ that we believe
	well-approximate (or may accurately describe) the relationship between the inputs
	and outputs. Finally we combine these using an algorithm $\mathcal{A}$
	that uses these to build a function that we can use to make predictions.
	In the following sections, we will discuss each of these components in
	more detail.
	}\DIFaddend \subsection{The Historical Data}
	Historical data refers to a set $\mathbb{D}$ of $n$ data points that are
	measured by observing the phenomenon. We can organize the data points
	as ordered pairs and enumerate them
	\begin{align*}
		\mathbb{D} = \{(\bm{x}_1,y_1), (\bm{x}_2,y_2),\ldots,(\bm{x}_n,y_n)\}
	\end{align*}
	where $y_k$ is the output for the $k$th observation, expressed as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$y=f(\bm{x}_k)$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$y_k=f(\bm{x}_k)$}\DIFaddend .
	For us, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{%
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$\bm{x}_k~=~\begin{bmatrix}
		x_{k,1} & x_{k,2} & x_{k, 3} & x_{k,4} & x_{k,5}
	\end{bmatrix}^\top$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{%
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
$\bm{x}_k~=~\begin{bmatrix}
		x_{k,1} & x_{k,2} & x_{k, 3} & x_{k,4} & x_{k,5} & x_{k, 6}
	\end{bmatrix}^\top$
}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , which identifies a person whose health habits are known,
	and who is known to have lived for $y_k$ years from birth to death.
	In the framework of supervised learning, a large number $n$ of data points
	is necessary to ensure the model can have a fair \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{shot }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{try }\DIFaddend at capturing different
	patterns and thereby accurately make predictions. If our intent is to predict
	human lifespan, then our $n$ must be reasonably large given that the world has about
	8 billion people \cite{Census-population}. An important consideration is how
	easily such data can be obtained.

	In measuring the human lifespan phenomenon, collecting each data point
	literally takes a lifetime; an observation is not complete until someone has
	died. We could gather data on the features of live people through a survey
	and collect their features as a vector $\bm{x}\in \mathcal{X}$, then when
	they have passed in the future we associate that vector with a lifespan
	$y\in\mathcal{Y}$. If we wanted to have data now, it might be expensive or
	impossible because of data protection laws. One crude way to gather some
	data about lifespans $y$ would be to use Wikipedia, which often lists the birth and
	death dates of individuals (with accuracy subject to verification), but
	we may not find the information on the specific features $\bm{x}$ that we
	are interested for that individual. After all, not everyone tracks how many
	alcoholic drinks they intake every day, or exactly how many hours of sleep they
	get at night. Moreover, technology such as smart watches to track a person's daily
	footstep count was either not invented or widely unavailable years ago.
	Another consideration is that we may need to prefer more recent deaths to
	account for the fact that human lifespan is a non-stationary phenomenon.
	\DIFaddbegin 

	\DIFadd{In summary, although we want a large number $n$ of data points, data collection
	can be challenging. If we started from zero data today, we would likely
	need about 150 years of data collection to construct a training sample.
	Thereafter, we would be able to use that data to train a model and
	to make predictions.
	}\DIFaddend \subsection{Hypothesis Set}
	The next part of the supervised learning framework deals with the
	infeasibility of an analytical solution. Simply put, $f$ is and will
	always be unknown, and it is likely much more complex than we can handle.
	Since we seek an approximate solution, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{our }\DIFaddend next task is to conjecture a
	functional form that we believe may well approximate $f$. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{notation
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{symbol
	}\DIFaddend $\mathcal{H}$ denotes a set of candidate functions, where $h\in \mathcal{H}$
	means that $h:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$, meaning $h$ is a function with
	the same domain and range as $f$. Our hope is to find the best function
	$h^*\in \mathcal{H}$ that approximates $f$. Such a function would be related
	to $y$, $t$, and $f$ by
	\begin{align*}
		y
		=t(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_t)
		=f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) + \delta
		=h^*(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) + \epsilon
	\end{align*}
	Here, $\epsilon$ is known as noise, which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is accrual of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{accrues }\DIFaddend the ignorance error \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and
	a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mentioned
	earlier, and a new error }\DIFaddend quantity known as misspecificaton error, expressed as
	$\epsilon-\delta = t-f$. To understand \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{where it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{how misspecification }\DIFaddend comes about, let us
	consider an example. Suppose we define the following set of
	candidate functions:
	\begin{align*}
		\mathcal{H}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_1 :}\DIFaddend = \{\,
		w_0+w_1x_1+w_2+w_3x_3+w_0x_4+w_5x_5 \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{+ w_6 x_6 }\DIFaddend \mid w_0,w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4,w_5\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, w_6}\DIFaddend \in\mathbb{R}
		\,\}
	\end{align*}
	Set $\mathcal{H}_1$ is the set of hyperplanes, which is a generalization of
	the idea of lines \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to }\DIFaddend higher dimensions. Such a choice is attractive because
	of the ease of interpretation of the results, and is appropriate if the
	data appears to have a ``linear" pattern. On the other hand, suppose our
	colleague proposes the following candidate set:
	\begin{align*}
		\mathcal{H}_2 = \{\,
		w_0 + w_1x_1x_2x_5 + w_2x_3x_4 \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{+ w_3 x_6^2 }\DIFaddend \mid w_0,w_1,w_2\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, w_3}\DIFaddend \in \mathbb{R}
		\,\}
	\end{align*}
	Our colleague reasons that people who smoke are also \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{most }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{more }\DIFaddend likely to drink,
	so the multiplicative term $x_3x_4$, which is known as a first-order interaction
	of features, accounts for this. Similarly, they argue \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that }\DIFaddend walking, sleeping,
	and interacting with friends compound on each other some way, leading to
	other lifespan gains. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Whether or not that is accurate}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Finally, they mention that current age weights heavily
	in the prediction, so it should be squared, yielding a transformed feature.
	Putting aside whether our colleague's claims are true}\DIFaddend ,
	this example demonstrates that there are many ways to design a candidate set. Not
	all candidate sets may be equally effective in approximating $f$. For example if the
	data has a parabolic pattern, fitting a line may not be a good idea. The misspecification
	error $\epsilon-\delta$ quantifies this ``mismatch" between the candidate set
	and the data set $\mathbb{D}$ that presumably came from $f$. I think our
	colleague may be right in considering a hypothesis set with interactions.
	For example, studies shows that smokers tend to sleep less than non-smokers
	\cite{SciDirect-smoking-sleeping}. Thus, interactions between the features
	may improve our model. However, they can also make our model more complex to
	reason about\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, so going }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. This trade-off between performance and interpretability
	is a recurring theme that plays an important role in the modeling enterprise.
	Going }\DIFaddend forward we will use \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\mathcal{H}_1$, hereby referring to it as just
	}\DIFaddend $\mathcal{H}$\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend as our set of candidate functions\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, because it is easier
	to interpret}\DIFaddend .
	\subsection{Algorithm}
	Once we have measured data $\mathbb{D}$ in the real world and chosen
	a candidate set of functions $\mathcal{H}$, we need a way to obtain
	a function $h$ from $\mathcal{H}$. The set $\mathcal{H}$ is infinite
	and we need a way to search the space efficiently to obtain an approximation
	to $f$. To do this, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we }\DIFaddend employ an algorithm, denoted $\mathcal{A}$, which
	is a finite sequence of steps devised to solve a problem. We can view
	an algorithm as a function \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A}(\mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H})$
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\mathcal{A}(\mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H})$
	}\DIFaddend that accepts a data set and a set of candidate functions and outputs
	an approximation $h\in\mathcal{H}$ to $f$. Earlier we said that $h^*$ is the
	best \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{approximations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{approximation }\DIFaddend to $f$ in $\mathcal{H}$, so naively we might hope for
	an algorithm \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to output }\DIFaddend $h^*$. Once again, though, we must temper our expectations;
	as we have emphasized, $\mathcal{H}$ is huge, uncountably-infinite as
	a matter of fact. Another way to think about it is that many functions
	do not attain all possible outputs in their co-domain, and the algorithm
	$\mathcal{A}$ that we use is no different. We will say that the best
	possible function that our algorithm can produce is $g\in\mathcal{H}$,
	related to $y$, $t$, $f$, and $h^*$ by
	\begin{align*}
		y
		= t(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_t)
		= f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) + \delta
		= h^*(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) + \epsilon
		= g(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) + e
	\end{align*}
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The symbol $e$ denotes a new type of error called a residual, and introducing
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Introducing }\DIFaddend $g$ also introduces a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend new type of error called estimation\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{error}\DIFdelend ,
	given by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the difference $h^*-g=e-\epsilon$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$h^* - g = e - \epsilon$. Thus the quantity $e$, called the residual,
	contains accrues ignorance, misspecification, and estimation.
	absorbed by the residual error $e$ that also happens to contain ignorance
	and misspecification}\DIFaddend . In a future section, we will discuss errors in more detail.

	Many ingenuous algorithms have been developed by very smart people,
	each subject to certain constraints and weighing different parts of the
	supervised learning problem differently. For example, if the response
	space in our phenomenon was binary, such as it would be if we were modeling
	the presence or absence of a disease, then we might encode that as \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{response in
	}\DIFaddend the set $\mathcal{Y}=\{0, 1\}$. One algorithm, known as perceptron, is
	applicable if the data set $\mathbb{D}$ satisfies a condition known as
	linear separability, which most data sets do not satisfy. Another algorithm,
	known as logistic regression, produces a candidate function $g$ whose
	output is not in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\mathcal{Y}$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\{0, 1\}$}\DIFaddend , but rather it outputs a probability
	that a person has the disease. In the case of human lifespan with a numeric
	response space $\mathcal{Y}=\mathbb{R}$, some plausible choices of algorithms
	are K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and ordinary least squares regression (OLS).
	In this paper, I will choose OLS \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with the linear candidate set $\mathcal{H}$
	that we introduced earlier. The appeal of this choice is that we can
	compute an exact solution $g$ using techniques from calculus and
	linear algebra. This is in contrast to other approaches for which no
	exact solutions exist, and instead an optimization algorithm is necessary}\DIFaddend .
	\section{Predictions}
	Before considering OLS, let us re-center ourselves by remembering why
	we are using supervised learning in the first place. We want to understand
	our phenomenon, or at least, we want to make predictions about the response
	of the phenomenon given a unit and their features. Suppose that Luis
	is 24-year old individual who works part-time with an interest in planning
	for retirement and in pursuing a college education. He determines that knowing how
	long he will be alive for will help in his planning. We offer Luis help, but we tell
	him that we need some information about him. After some initial hesitation to share
	personal information, we gather the following vector:
	\begin{align*}
		\bm{x}_{\text{Luis}} = \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \begin{bmatrix}
%DIFDELCMD < 			12042 & 7.3 & 0.1 & 0 & 15.7
%DIFDELCMD < 		\end{bmatrix}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \begin{bmatrix}
			12042 & 7.3 & 0.1 & 0 & 15.7 & 24
		\end{bmatrix}\DIFaddend ^\top
	\end{align*}
	That is, Luis walks on average 12,042 steps each day, sleep on average 7.3 hours
	each night, drinks 0.1 glasses of wine each day on average, does not smoke at all,
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and
	}\DIFdelend spends about $15.7$ hours a week on average socialization with friends and family\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
	and has lived for 24 years}\DIFaddend .
	Having applied our algorithm and obtained a function $g=\mathcal{A}(\mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H})$,
	we can use $g$ to make a prediction. For example, suppose that our algorithm
	produced the vector
	\begin{align*}
		\bm{b} = \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \begin{bmatrix}
%DIFDELCMD < 			10 & \frac{1}{1000} & \frac{20}{8} & 5 & -10 & 3
%DIFDELCMD < 		\end{bmatrix}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \begin{bmatrix}
			10 & \frac{1}{1000} & \frac{20}{8} & 5 & -10 & 3 & 24
		\end{bmatrix}\DIFaddend 
	\end{align*}
	Then our function $g$ is given by
	\begin{align*}
		\hat{y} = g(\bm{x}) = 10 + \frac{1}{1000}x_1 + \frac{20}{8}x_2 & 5x_3 - 10x_4 + 3x_5
		\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{-0.1x_6
	}\DIFaddend \end{align*}
	The quantity $\hat{y}$ is the predicted number of years for a person
	whose feature as given by the feature vector $\bm{x}$. For Luis, we
	can compute this number explicitly using our made-up model $g$:
	\begin{align*}
		g(\bm{x}_{\text{Luis}}) = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{87.892
	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{85.492
	}\DIFaddend \end{align*}
	That is, our model predicts that Luis will live for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{almost $88$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{about $85$ }\DIFaddend years.
	Luis seems a bit disheartened, sharing that he wanted to live longer,
	but he is also curious as to whether our prediction is accurate. We tell
	Luis that our model is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{still experimental}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an approximation}\DIFaddend , so he should not let it have
	the final word. We humbly also tell him that there may be better models out
	there. How can we ensure that our model is as good as can be? We need
	an error metric.
	\section{Types of Error}
	Before discussing error metrics, we need to understand discuss how errors
	are introduced in our modeling framework. The first type of error, ignorance
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{erro(r}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{error}\DIFaddend , arises from using features $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p$ as proxies for
	the the true drivers (casual inputs) $z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_t$ and a function
	$f$ domain contains the possible values of these features instead of
	the true phenomenon function $t$:
	\begin{align*}
		y = t(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_t)=f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) +\delta
	\end{align*}
	The error due to ignorance accounts for the fact that the features do not
	contain the same information density as the true drivers. One way to
	deal ignorance is to introduce new relevant features to describe the
	phenomenon, thus increasing the number of features $p$ per observation.
	The next approximation we made was to introduce $h^*$ from some candidate
	set $\mathcal{H}$:
	\begin{align*}
		f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) + \delta = h^*(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) + \epsilon
	\end{align*}
	The quantity $\epsilon$ is known as the noise, and the difference
	$\epsilon-\delta=f-h^*$ is the misspecification error. We touched on this
	earlier, and it is a result of choosing a candidate set $\mathcal{H}$ that
	may not correctly capture the functional form of $f$. For example, if the
	points in $\mathbb{D}$, presumably produced by $f$ (subject to some error
	due to $\delta$) seem to follow a parabolic pattern, then a set of
	hyperplanes may accrue some misspecification error. One way to reduce
	misspecification is to choose a larger set of candidate functions.
	The last type of error is known as the residual \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, which }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{error, and }\DIFaddend shows up when we obtain a modeling function $g$ from our algorithm:
	\begin{align*}
		h^*(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) + \epsilon = g(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_p) + \epsilon
	\end{align*}
	The residual contains the ignorance and misspecification error, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend it
	adds a new type of error known as estimation error, given by $e-\epsilon = h^*-g$.
	The estimation error results from not being able to obtain the best possible
	function $h^*$ out of $\mathcal{H}$. One way to reduce estimation error is to
	employ a better algorithm $\mathcal{A}$. Another way is to ensure that
	the features that we use are indeed relevant. For example, suppose that
	a colleague recommends that we use a new feature \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$x_6$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$x_7$ }\DIFaddend that represents
	the number of digits of $\pi$ that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{you know. You find it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a person knows. It is }\DIFaddend hard to believe that
	this affects lifespan at all. Suppose \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{you }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we }\DIFaddend are omniscient and know that it
	indeed has nothing to do with lifespan. If \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{your }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{our }\DIFaddend model accounts for it
	and produces a non-negative weight associated with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$x_6$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$x_7$}\DIFaddend , then we accrue
	estimation error. Estimation error can also increase if we decide to transform
	our features, perhaps by introducing a new feature that is the square
	of an existing feature. For example, if we had a single feature $x_1$
	and believed the data set had a quadratic pattern relative to this feature,
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{then }\DIFaddend we would create a transformed feature $x_1^2$ to allow for parabolic
	solutions out of our candidate set. This may lead to a decrease in misspecification
	error, but possibly an increase in estimation error.

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We have the most control over the residual error $e$.
	Next, we discuss error metrics, and regularly consider residual error in our calculations. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Another way to reduce misspecification is to ensure we use the correct
	model. Earlier we favored $\mathcal{H}_1$ over $\mathcal{H}_2$ on
	the premise that $\mathcal{H}_1$ is more interpretable. However, if
	$\mathcal{H}_1$ does not perform well in comparison to $\mathcal{H}_2$,
	then we may want to choose $\mathcal{H}_2$ anyway. Model selection involves
	computing different predictions, possibly with the same or different
	algorithms or candidate sets, and measuring their predictive performance
	to see which one is more accurate. For example we would compute
	$g_1 = \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H}_1)$ and $g_2 = \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H}_2)$, and select the one whose error metric is smallest.
	}

	\DIFadd{In the current setting of human lifespan, I expect ignorance error and
	misspecification error to be most prevalent because $6$ features is likely
	too few, and a linear relationship between them is unlikely.
	}\DIFaddend \section{Error Metrics}
	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Suppose we have computed a prediction function with our model
	}\begin{align*}
		\DIFadd{g = \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H})
	}\end{align*}
	\DIFadd{How good is $g$ at predicting? For example, if $g$ is any good,
	then we might expect that for a unit $(\bm{x}, y)$ for which
	the response $y$ is known,
	the value $g(\bm{x})$ might be close to $\hat{y}=g(\bm{x})$. In fact, the
	residual which we defined earlier is a good start point
	}\begin{align*}
		\DIFadd{e = y - g(\bm{x})
	}\end{align*}
	\DIFadd{We can think of the residual as how far our prediction is from the
	actual response. The error is zero when the prediction is exactly
	equal to the response, and otherwise it may be positive or negative
	depending on whether it overshoots the response or not.
	}

	\DIFadd{Given $n$ data points $(\bm{x}_1,y_1),\ldots,(\bm{x}_n,y_n)$, we can
	compute $n$ corresponding residuals $e_1,\ldots,e_n$. One error metric
	that we can define with these residuals is called the sum-of-squared errors:
	}\begin{align*}
		\DIFadd{SSE := \sum_{k=1}^{n}e_k^2
	}\end{align*}
	\DIFadd{The $SSE$ is useful, but it suffers from at least two problems: it
	inevitably grows as $n$ increases, and the units are the square of
	the response units (what do we make of squared years?). One way to
	handle the dependence on $n$ is to divide by $n$, thereby yielding
	the mean-squared error (MSE) metric:
	}\begin{align*}
		\DIFadd{MSE := \frac{1}{n}SSE
	}\end{align*}
	\DIFadd{Then to ensure the error units match the response units, we can take
	the squared root, yielding the root-mean squared error (RMSE) metric:
	}\begin{align*}
		\DIFadd{RMSE := \sqrt{MSE}
	}\end{align*}
	\DIFadd{Thus, to compare the performance of two models, we can compute their
	$RMSE$ on the same set of data points. We say the model with a smaller
	$RMSE$ performs better.
	}

	\DIFadd{Another error popular error metric based on the $SSE$ is the $R^2$ metric:
	}\begin{align*}
		\DIFadd{R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST}
	}\end{align*}
	\DIFadd{where $SST$ is the $SSE$ of what is known as the null model (discussed
	in a later section). The $R^2$ for a good model would ideally be
	close to $1$, and closer to (or below) $0$ would indicate poor
	performance. However, the $R^2$ metric is not as interpretable
	as $RMSE$. To provide users of this model with a simpler interpretation,
	I would use $RMSE$ instead of $R^2$.
	}

	\subsection{\DIFadd{In-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample Metrics}}

	\DIFadd{The discussion so far has mentioned computing the $SSE$ for a collection
	of $n$ points, but not which $n$ points. When the collection of points
	on which the $SSE$ is computed is precisely $\mathbb{D}$, the collection
	of points on which the model was trained, we call the corresponding
	metrics in-sample metrics. However, if we compute the error metrics on
	a set $\mathbb{D}_*$ (from the same phenomenon of course) but disjoint from
	$\mathbb{D}$, then we call the metrics out-of-sample metrics.
	}

	\DIFadd{The distinction between in-sample and out-of-sample metrics is critical.
	It can be shown that in-sample metrics are dishonest, in the sense that it is
	possible to obtain excellent in-sample performance (all the way to an $SSE$ of $0$)
	by adding garbage features that have nothing to do with the phenomenon.
	Yet, the out-of-sample error metrics would increase, as they should
	in the face of unrelated information. This phenomenon is called overfitting,
	and it occurs because a larger set of features enables a larger
	set of candidate functions $\mathcal{H}$ that can be better tailored
	to the particular set $\mathbb{D}$. Put another way, overfitting
	is akin to getting lost in the noise while looking for a signal
	\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Silver-signal-and-noise}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. In contrast, underfitting occurs
	when $\mathcal{H}$ is relatively small, whereby the model performs
	poorly because the functions are too simple to capture the functional
	relationship between the inputs and outputs. To detect overfitting,
	we need to compute out-of-sample metrics, which unlike in-sample
	metrics are honest. Another reason why the distinction matters is because
	the point of building a prediction model is to predict for out-of-sample
	data. For example, Luis from our earlier example is an out-of-sample data
	point, who had the fair question about how accurate our model is,
	which we can answer in terms of the out-of-sample $RMSE$.
	}

	\DIFadd{It is likely that our approach to predicting human lifespan with 6 features
	and a linear model will severely underfit. We could address this by adding
	other features, such as the country a person lives, or how much money they
	earn, and choosing a more complicated set $\mathcal{H}$.
	However, as we discussed earlier, collecting data about the given 6 features
	we mentioned is already difficult, so data collection can be even more
	complicated if we add other predictors. Picking other candidate sets can
	also be difficult, especially when there is more than 1 input,
	since it is harder to visualize the data.
	}

	\DIFaddend \section{The Null Model}
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Before we consider OLS, it is worth thinking about what,
	if anything, we can achieve without one}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A simple idea we have not considered is whether we need any
	features or an algorithm at all}\DIFaddend . In other words, suppose
	we go on Wikipedia and learned the lifespan $y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n$
	of $n$ different people. However, their Wikipedia page did not
	have information about the number of steps they walked each day,
	the number of hours they slept each night, or any of the features
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5, x_6$ }\DIFaddend that we are using as proxies to the true drivers.
	In the absence of feature, there is still one model we can employ:
	the null model. Denoted $g_0$, the null model also comes from
	the hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$, so its form depends on the
	functional forms allowed by $\mathcal{H}$. Thus, we know at the
	very least that $g_0$ gets its input from $\mathcal{X}$ and
	outputs a value in $\mathcal{Y}$. Since $\mathcal{Y}=\mathbb{R}$
	is numeric, the null model corresponds to computing the arithmetic
	mean:
	\begin{align*}
		g_0(\bm{x})= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i
	\end{align*}
	That is, to make a prediction about the lifespan of an individual
	whose features are $\bm{x}$, we actually ignore the features,
	and predict that their lifespan is simply the average of the lifespan
	of the $n$ individuals we have seen. In some way, this is justified
	if we truly know nothing about each person other than how long they
	lived. The null model is useful because it can act as a reference for
	performance. It stands to reason that if we have accurate features
	about the health habits of an individual, if those features \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are
	useful at all as predictors }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have
	any predictive value }\DIFaddend for lifespan, and if our algorithm
	is any good, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{then }\DIFaddend our computed model $g$ ought to do better than $g_0$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
	which literally knows nothing about the person.
	In a future session, we will discuss errors and how to
	determine whether our model performs
	better than }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
	To determine how well }\DIFaddend $g_0$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{performs, we can compute its $SSE$, traditionally denoted
	as $SSE_0$ or equivalently $SST$ for sum-of-squared totals. Thus, in addition to
	serving as a reasonable model when we don't have any features to
	make predictions, the performance for $g_0$ can serve as as threshold
	for performance of any other model we make}\DIFaddend .
	\section{Ordinary Least Squares Regression}
	To understand ordinary least squares, suppose that the number of features
	in our model is $p=1$. For concreteness, say that we are only tracking
	$x_1$, the number of steps a person walks each day, hereby referred to
	as $x$ for this example. Then our data set $\mathbb{D}$ is a list of points
	in the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate plane:
	\begin{align*}
		\mathbb{D} = \{
		(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)
		\}
	\end{align*}
	Note that $x_1$ in this example is the number of steps the first person walks each day,
	not the generic name for the walk feature, and $x_2$ is the number of steps
	the second person sleeps, not the generic name for the daily sleep feature.
	We can visualize $\mathbb{D}$ using a scatterplot\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as in Figure~\ref{fig:example-dataset-1-feature}.
	}%DIFDELCMD < \begin{figure}
%DIFDELCMD < 		\centering
%DIFDELCMD < 		\label{fig:example-dataset-1-feature}
%DIFDELCMD < 	\end{figure}
%DIFDELCMD < 	%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
	}\DIFaddend In the past, you may have learned about the idea of the line of best fit.
	A general line has the equation $\hat{y} = w_0 + w_1x$ for some parameters
	$w_0,w_1\in\mathbb{R}$. For the value of the feature $x_k$ corresponding
	to the number of steps the $k$th person takes daily, the line would predict
	$\hat{y}_k = w_0+w_1x_k$. The actual response for the $k$th person is
	$y_k$, so the error in the prediction with this line is $e_k = y_k-\hat{y}_k$.
	Since we have $n$ points, that implies $n$ residual errors $e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_n$.
	The idea of ordinary least squares is to pick a pair of parameters
	$b_0,b_1\in \mathbb{R}$ defining a line $\hat{y}=g(x)=b_0+b_1x$ so that
	the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sum of the squares of the errors, denoted }\DIFdelend $SSE$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend given by
	\begin{align*}
		SSE := \sum_{k=1}^{n}e_k^2 = \sum_{k=1}^{n}(y_k-\hat{y}_k)^2
	\end{align*}
	 is as small as possible. Implicit is our discussion is the assumption that
	 out algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ is searching through a space $\mathcal{H}$ of all
	 possible lines, which is indeed the case since earlier de fined
	 $\mathcal{H}$ to be the set of hyperplanes. The algorithm, then
	 can be expressed as
	 \begin{align*}
	 	\bm{b} = \underset{\bm{w}\in \mathbb{R}^{p+1}}{\text{argmin}}\{SSE\}
	 \end{align*}
	 where $\bm{b}=\begin{bmatrix}
	 	b_0 & b_1 & b_2 & \cdots & b_p
	 \end{bmatrix}^\top$ is a vector of all the least square parameters.
	 In our example, $p=1$, so we would have $\bm{b}=\begin{bmatrix}
	 	b_0 & b_1
	 \end{bmatrix}^\top$. Note the procedure for the algorithm can be
	 read as ``find the parameters that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{minimized }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{minimize }\DIFaddend the $SSE$".

	 Admittedly, ordinary least squares may not be a suitable algorithm to use
	 if our data set $\mathbb{D}$ does not suggest a linear trend. However, what is
	 attractive is that under mild conditions it admits an exact solution
	 $g=\mathcal{A}(\mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H})$. Indeed, throughout our discussion,
	 we have had to give up hope on finding an exact solution for $h^*$,
	 $f$, and $t$, so why would $g$ be any different? It turns out that many
	 minimization problems like the one for $SSE$ do not have exact solutions
	 and required complicated optimization algorithms to give an approximate
	 solution. Thus, when it comes to being able to state a precise solution,
	 OLS is the exception, not the rule.

	 That is not to say that $g$, the function determine by the OLS procedure,
	 will be effective for making predictions. We know, for example, that there are
	 some optimal weights $\beta_0,\beta_1\in\mathbb{R}$ defining a linear function
	 $h^*(x) = \beta_0+\beta_1 x$ that our algorithm will not produce.
	 Since our $g$ is different from $h^*$, we accrue estimation error\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

	 given by
	 }\begin{align*}
	 	\DIFadd{h^*  - g= e - \epsilon
	 }\end{align*}
	 \DIFadd{Moreover, if the lifespan phenomenon is not linear in the walking feature
	 (say it's quadratic), then we incur misspecification error, given by
	 }\begin{align*}
	 	\DIFadd{\epsilon - \delta = f - h
	 }\end{align*}
	 \DIFadd{Of course, there is also ignorance error, which we cannot do anything about.
	 An advantage of a linear model is that it is highly interpretable. For example, suppose
	 we get
	 }\begin{align*}
	 	\DIFadd{\hat{y} = g(x) = 20 + \frac{1}{1000}x
	 }\end{align*}
	 \DIFadd{Then we can say that for every 1000 steps extra that a person takes daily
	 on average, their lifespan increases by 1 year. Extending the OLS algorithm
	 to more features is not much more difficult after introducing some notions
	 of linear algebra and calculus.
	 }\section{\DIFadd{Alternative Algorithms and Models}}
	 \DIFadd{In an earlier section I made the decision to use the OLS algorithm
	 to model the lifespan phenomenon. A merit of OLS is that it is
	 heavily studied, so more precise statements can be made about its
	 properties. However, it is worth considering what alternatives exist.
	 For modeling a numeric response like lifespan, for example, we could
	 also use a tree model with a regression tree partitioning algorithm.
	 More generally, we may have $M$ pairs of algorithms and models
	 }\begin{align*}
	 	\DIFadd{(\mathcal{A}_1,\mathcal{H}_1),\ldots,(\mathcal{A}_M, \mathcal{H}_M)
	 }\end{align*}
	 \DIFadd{How do we decide on which one is best? One approach is to take the
	 training data $\mathbb{D}$ and split it into two pieces: $\mathbb{D}_{\text{train}}$
	 and $\mathbb{D}_{\text{test}}$. For each pair, we compute a prediction function
	 on $\mathbb{D}_{\text{train}}$, and we compute an out-of-sample metric
	 by predicting $\mathbb{D}_{\text{test}}$:
	 }\begin{align*}
	 	\DIFadd{g_1 }&\DIFadd{= \mathcal{A}_1(\mathbb{D}_{\text{train}}, \mathcal{H}_1)\quad
	 	\implies g_1(\mathbb{D}_{\text{test}})\quad \implies RMSE_1}\\
	 	&\DIFadd{\vdots }\\ 
	 	\DIFadd{g_M }&\DIFadd{= \mathcal{A}_M(\mathbb{D}_{\text{train}}, \mathcal{H}_M)\quad
	 	\implies g_M\mathbb{D}_{\text{test}})\quad \implies RMSE_M
	 }\end{align*}
	 \DIFadd{We would then choose the model $(\mathcal{A}_{m_*}, \mathcal{H}_{m_*}$
	 for which $g_m*$ had the lowest $RMSE$. That is, model $m_*$ is what
	 we would deem to be our best model, so we can compute a final prediction
	 function by training it not just on $\mathbb{D}_{\text{train}}$ but on
	 all of $\mathbb{D}$:
	 }\begin{align*}
	 	\DIFadd{g_{\text{final}} = \mathcal{A}_{m_*}(\mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H}_{m_*})
	 }\end{align*}
	 \DIFadd{This basic approach has some limitations, but a variation of this idea
	 can address some of them.
	 }\section{\DIFadd{Conclusion}}
	 \DIFadd{I believe the title of my essay is incorrect. The problem with a linear model
	 is that it is too simple to describe the relationships between the factors
	 that contribute to healthy aging. For example, the coefficients of each
	 feature in a linear model have either a positive or negative sign, indicating
	 that the feature always has a positive or a negative effect in the person's
	 lifespan. However, it may be that a moderate amount of walking has positive
	 effects, whereas walking 40,000 steps each day may have an adverse effect.
	 A linear model will not capture this dynamic, and will suffer heavily from
	 extrapolation.
